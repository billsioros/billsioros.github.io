          I'm currently working on my thesis wherein we explore harnessing cross attention control for instruction-based auto-regressive audio editing.

          Leveraging the Prompt-to-Prompt concept, originally used in image editing, we expand its functionality for intuitive audio manipulation. Users can edit audio content based on textual prompts without necessitating model modifications, retraining, or additional data.

          This research pioneers the application of these techniques to auto-regressive text-to-audio models, showing promise for breakthroughs in AI-driven audio synthesis and creative expression.

          Carried out my BSc thesis "Generating realistic nanorough surfaces via a Generative Adversarial Network" under the supervision of Dr. G.Giannakopoulos and Dr. V.Constantoudis.

          We focused on how a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based approach, given a nanorough surface data set, can learn to produce statistically equivalent samples. Additionally, we examined how pairing our model with a set of nanorough similarity metrics, can improve the realisticity of the resulting nanorough surfaces. We showcased via multiple experiments that our framework is able to produce sufficiently realistic nanorough surfaces, in many cases indistinguishable from real data.

          - Worked on the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3549737.3549794) Generating Realistic Nanorough Surfaces Using an N-Gram-Graph Augmented Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network which is a derivative of my BSc thesis.
          - Presented our findings at 12th EETN Conference on Artificial Intelligence, [SETN 2022](https://hilab.di.ionio.gr/setn2022/).
