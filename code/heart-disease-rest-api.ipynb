    "# Building a REST API: FastAPI to the Rescue!\n",
    "\n",
    "Heart disease is like the uninvited guest that crashes the party, causing 17.9 million deaths every year—about 31% of all deaths worldwide, with many victims under 70. But what if we could predict when this party crasher is coming? That’s where machine learning steps in, superhero-style! These models act like crystal balls for your health, scanning data for warning signs like high blood pressure or cholesterol to predict who’s at risk of heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a [previous post](https://billsioros.github.io/posts/heart-disease-prediction/), we trained one of these models using the [Heart Disease Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction). Now, we’re going to kick things up a notch and build a REST API to make this model accessible to the world! And our tool of choice? [`FastAPI`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), *a lightning-fast, easy-to-use framework that makes building APIs with Python a breeze.*\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what’s a [`REST`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) API, you ask? It’s how apps talk to each other over the internet. REST APIs handle requests like `GET` (grab info), `POST` (send info), `PUT` (update info), and `DELETE` (bye-bye info). FastAPI makes setting this up simple, fast, and fun. Ready to dive in? Let’s get started!\n"

    "## Crafting a Data Blueprint\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need a blueprint for the data that users will send us, kind of like a form where they fill in their details. For this, we use [`Pydantic`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/). So, what’s Pydantic? Think of it as the bouncer for your API—it checks that all incoming data is valid and properly structured before letting it through.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a quick rundown of what’s happening:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is our blueprint for incoming data. It’s like a form where users fill in their details. Each field comes with rules (e.g., age must be between 0 and 130) so we’re working with data that makes sense and fits what our machine learning model needs.\n",
    "- We use `IntEnum` from Python’s `enum` module to handle categories like `Sex`, `ChestPain`, and `StSlope`. These ensure only valid options are passed.\n",
    "- The `Field` function lets us set validation rules (e.g., minimum and maximum values) and add descriptions. This way, anyone using the API knows exactly what each field is for—no guesswork required!\n",
    "- The `HeartBeatSchema` is an extension of `HeartBeatCreateSchema`. It adds extra fields like `id`, which acts as a unique identifier for each record, and `heart_disease`, which holds the prediction from our model. Think of `HeartBeatSchema` as mimicking a database record creation operation—it's what you'll get back once the data is processed and stored."
