But what if we could predict when this party crasher is coming? That’s where machine learning steps in, superhero-style! These models act like crystal balls for your health, scanning data for warning signs like high blood pressure or cholesterol to predict who’s at risk of heart disease.</description></item><item><title>Heart Disease Prediction</title><link>https://billsioros.github.io/posts/heart-disease-prediction/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://billsioros.github.io/posts/heart-disease-prediction/</guid><description>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are like the ultimate party crashers, claiming the lives of 17.9 million people every year—that’s a whopping 31% of all deaths worldwide! Most of these are due to heart attacks and strokes, and what’s even scarier is that many victims are under 70. But what if we could see these crashers coming from a mile away? Enter machine learning: the superhero of the data world.
Machine learning models can dig through mountains of data to spot patterns and predict who might be at risk of heart disease.</description></item><item><title>Exploratory Data Analysis</title><link>https://billsioros.github.io/posts/exploratory-data-analysis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://billsioros.github.io/posts/exploratory-data-analysis/</guid><description>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is like being a detective at a party full of numbers. Let&amp;rsquo;s take the Heart Disease Prediction Dataset as an example.
Imagine you walk into this party, and instead of guests, there are columns of data: ages, blood pressures, cholesterol levels, and so on. Your job as the detective is to mingle with these numbers, get to know them, and uncover their secrets.
You start by looking around to see who&amp;rsquo;s who.</description></item></channel></rss>
