Let&amp;rsquo;s take the &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction">Heart Disease Prediction Dataset&lt;/a> as an example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Imagine you walk into this party, and instead of guests, there are columns of data: ages, blood pressures, cholesterol levels, and so on. Your job as the detective is to mingle with these numbers, get to know them, and uncover their secrets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You start by looking around to see who&amp;rsquo;s who. You might notice that the average age of the guests is around 50. Maybe you spot some interesting patterns, like how those with high cholesterol tend to hang out in one corner. You create some cool charts and graphs, which are like taking snapshots of the party. These visuals help you see at a glance who the outliers areâ€”the really tall guy in the middle of a crowd of short folks, or the person who&amp;rsquo;s overdressed for the occasion.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
